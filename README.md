**AIM:**

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

SR Flip-Flop SR flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, SR latch operates with enable signal. The circuit diagram of SR flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs S & R and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of SR flipflop is similar to SR Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of SR flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, SR flip-flop can be used for one of these three functions such as Hold, Reset & Set based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of SR flip-flop. Present Inputs Present State Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. The three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)

**Procedure**
1. Define Inputs/Outputs: Inputs: S (Set), R (Reset), c1k (clock); Outputs: Q, Qbar.
2. Initialization: Set Q = 0 and Qbar = 1 at the start of the simulation.
3. SR Flip-Flop Logic: On posedge c1k, compute Q = S | (~R & Q).
4. Complementary Output: Update Qbar = R | (~S & Qbar) to maintain SR Flip-Flop behavior.
5. Testbench: Test with combinations of S, R, and c1k to ensure proper Set-Reset functionality.
